## This doesn’t fix the main problem.

- Old private keys can still be used to claim balances on the new chain.
- The only use for a hard fork is removing the estimated ~4 million ‘lost’ bitcoin to prevent them from being stolen
- Any such move will be extremely controversial within the Bitcoin community
- Who gets to decide which wallets stay and which ones go? And when do you pull the trigger?
