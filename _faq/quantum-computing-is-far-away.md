Some experts predict it will be a problem for Bitcoin’s digital signatures within the decade. Even pessimistic estimates put ‘Y2Q’ at around 30 years away.

- The process of quantum-proofing Bitcoin will take years. Active users will need ample time to move their funds.
- Several years before the Bitcoin-cracking quantum computer actually exists, a time will come when we are no longer sure that it does not. At that point, Bitcoin’s security can no longer be trusted, and it’s already too late.
- Those who bet against science and technological progress almost always end up on the wrong side of history.
