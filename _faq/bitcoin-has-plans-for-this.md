title: "Bitcoinâ€™s developers have already planned for this"

Their current best plan will not be enough to avoid severe challenges.

- A discussion from early 2018 laid out a soft-fork proposal, but this would still leave millions of bitcoin in vulnerable addresses with lost private keys
- Recently, longer signatures (nominally harder to crack) were proposed in a dev discussion. This is a stopgap at best.
- Any soft-fork solution requires all active users to comply. Those who do not put not only their own funds but the security of the entire network at risk.
