## And it's time we take notice

- NISQ Era devices on the horizon[^NISQ].
- It presents revolutionary opportunities for AI[^AI], chemistry[^CHEM], materials science[^MATERIALS], finance[^FINANCE], and more. 
- The USA[^USA], China[^CHINA], and EU[^EU] and other nation states are investing heavily into quantum computing. 
- Tech giants such as Google[^GOOGLE], IBM[^IBM], Intel[^INTEL], and Microsoft[^MICROSOFT] are already competing for market share.

As a byproduct of this global arms race, quantum computers powerful enough to break modern cryptography are expected to exist within 10-20 years, if not sooner.
