- Quantum computing is finally on the verge of becoming commercially useful.
- It presents revolutionary opportunities for AI, chemistry, materials science, finance, and more. 
- The USA, China, and EU are investing billions into research.
- Tech giants such as Google, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft are already competing for market share.
- As a byproduct of this global arms race, quantum computers powerful enough to break modern cryptography are expected to exist within 10-20 years, if not sooner.
