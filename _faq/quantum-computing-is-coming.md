## Here's what you need to know

- NISQ Era devices are on the horizon[^NISQ].
- Quantum computing is finally on the verge of becoming commercially useful[^COMM].
- Quantum Computing is developing at a steady pace[^PACE].
- It presents revolutionary opportunities for AI[^AI], chemistry[^CHEM], materials science[^MATERIALS], finance[^FINANCE], and more. 
- The USA[^USA], China[^CHINA], EU[^EU] and other nation states are investing heavily into quantum computing. 
- Tech giants such as Google[^GOOGLE], IBM[^IBM], Intel[^INTEL], Rigetti[^RIGETTI] and Microsoft[^MICROSOFT] are already competing for market share.
- Not all research is public[^PRIVATE]
- Breakthroughs in related scientific fields (like material science) occur frequently, and could drastically shorten the timeline for a powerful universal QC [^BREAKTHRU]

As a byproduct of this global technilogical arms race, quantum computers powerful enough to break modern cryptography are expected to exist within 10-20 years, if not sooner.
