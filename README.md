## Content

### Guidelines

Right now content is broken into common questions and statements that people have about Blockchain and Quantum Computing. This is designed to address them in a way that's digestible in 2 - 5 seconds. This means content that is:

1. Heavy on sources
2. Has an ELI8 reading level
3. Has a general appeal to authority
4. While not always possible, keeping bullets from 3-5
5. A subheading that explains the bulletpoints in a memerable way.

### Future Content

There are thoughts to have this be a resource that people can also dive deeper. Thoughts on how to go about this without losing the simplicity of the site are very welcome.
